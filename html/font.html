            Shimoga, officially known as Shivamogga,is a city and the
            district headquarters of Shimoga district in the central part of
            the state of Karnataka, India. The city lies on the banks of the
            Tunga River. Being the gateway for the hilly region of the
            Western Ghats, the city is popularly nicknamed as "Gateway to
            Malnad".
            <br>
            <br>
            The population of Shimoga city is 322,650 as per
            2011 census.[1] The city has been selected for the Smart Cities

            The city is 569 m above sea level and is surrounded by lush
            green paddy fields, arecanut and coconut groves. It is located
            267 kms from the state capital Bangalore and 195 kms from the
            port city Mangalore.
            The name of the city is derived from the term "shivmoga". A
            version of etymology is due to the story that Lord Shiva drank
            the Tunga river water using "Mogge", hence the name Shivamogga". Another version of etymology is that the name is
            derived from the term "Sihi-Mogge", meaning "sweet pot".[6]
            The district formed the southern tip of the Emperor Ashoka's
            Mauryan Empire in the third century BC. It was ruled during
            later centuries by the Kadambas (4th century), Chalukyas (6th
            century), Ganges, Rashtrakutas (8th century), Hoysalas (11th
            century), and the Vijayanagara rulers (15th century). The city
            got an independent identity under the Keladi Nayakas' rule
            during the 16th century. From the late 17th century, the city had
            been a part of the Kingdom of Mysore until the independence of
            India in 1947, when the Mysore state merged into the Republic
            of India

            Mysore[14] (/maɪˈsɔːr/ ( listen)), officially Mysuru ([ˈmaɪ'suːɾu]
            ( listen)), is a city in the southern part of the state of Karnataka, India.
            [15]
            Mysore city is geographically located between 12° 18′ 26″ north latitude
            and 76° 38′ 59″ east longitude. It is located at an altitude of 770 m
            (2,530 ft) above mean sea level.
            Mysore is located in the foothills of the Chamundi Hills about 145.2 km
            (90 mi) towards the southwest of Bangalore and spread across an area of
            286.05 km2
            (110 sq mi). Mysore City Corporation is responsible for the
            civic administration of the city, which is also the headquarters of the
            Mysore district and the Mysore division. In November 2020, A gazetted
            notification was passed by the state government converting nearby
            census town of Hootagalli into a City Municipal Council along with four
            more Town Panchayats of Bhogadi, Kadakola, Rammanahalli and
            Srirampura, expanding the city area from 155.7 sq.km to 286.05
            sq.km.[16][17] This also increased the population of the urban
            agglomeration from 990,900 to 1,060,120.[16][17][18][19][20][21][22]
            According to United Nations, Mysuru is projected to have a population of
            1.162 million in 2018, making it the second largest city in the state.[23]
            It served as the capital city of the Kingdom of Mysore for nearly six
            centuries from 1399 until 1956. The Kingdom was ruled by the Wadiyar
            dynasty, with a brief period of interregnum in the late 18th century when
            Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan were in power. The Wadiyars were patrons of
            art and culture. Tipu Sultan and Hyder Ali also contributed significantly
            to the cultural and economic growth of the city and the state by planting
            mulberry trees introducing silk in the region and fighting 4 AngloMysore wars against the British. The cultural ambience and
            achievements of Mysore earned it the sobriquet Cultural Capital of
            Karnataka.
            Mysore is noted for its heritage structures and palaces, including the
            Mysore Palace, and for the festivities that take place during the Dasara
            festival when the city receives many tourists from around the world. It
            lends its name to various art forms and culture, such as Mysore Dasara,
            Mysore painting; the sweet dish Mysore Pak, Mysore Masala Dosa;
            brands such as Mysore Sandal Soap, Mysore Ink; and styles and
            cosmetics such as Mysore Peta (a traditional silk turban) and the Mysore
            silk saris. Mysore is also known for its special variety of jasmine flower
            fondly referred as "Mysore Mallige" and betel leaves. Tourism is the
            major industry alongside the traditional industries. Mysore's inter-city
            public transportation includes rail, bus and flights.[24]

            Bangalore /bæŋɡəˈlɔːr/, officially known as Bengaluru[12]
            ([ˈbeŋɡəɭuːɾu] ( listen)), is the capital and the largest city of the
            Indian state of Karnataka. It has a population of more than
            8 million and a metropolitan population of around 11 million,
            making it the third most populous city and fifth most populous
            urban agglomeration in India.[13] Located in southern India on
            the Deccan Plateau, at a height of over 900 m (3,000 ft) above sea
            level, Bangalore is known for its pleasant climate throughout the
            year. Its elevation is the highest among the major cities of
            India.[14]
            The city's history dates back to around 890 CE, in a stone
            inscription found at the Nageshwara Temple in Begur, Bangalore.
            The Begur inscription is written in Halegannada (ancient
            Kannada), mentions 'Bengaluru Kalaga' (battle of Bengaluru). It
            was a significant turning point in the history of Bangalore as it
            bears the earliest reference to the name 'Bengaluru'.[15] In
            1537 CE, Kempé Gowdā – a feudal ruler under the Vijayanagara
            Empire – established a mud fort considered to be the foundation
            of modern Bangalore and its oldest areas, or petes, which exist to
            the present day. After the fall of Vijayanagar empire in 16th
            century, the Mughals sold Bangalore to Chikkadevaraja Wodeyar
            (1673–1704), the then ruler of the Kingdom of Mysore for three
            lakh rupees.[16]
             When Haider Ali seized control of the Kingdom of
            Mysore, the administration of Bangalore passed into his hands. It
            was captured by the British East India Company after victory in
            the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War (1799), who returned
            administrative control of the city to the Maharaja of Mysore. The
            old city developed in the dominions of the Maharaja of Mysore
            and was made capital of the Princely State of Mysore, which
            existed as a nominally sovereign entity of the British Raj. In 1809,
            the British shifted their cantonment to Bangalore, outside the old
            city, and a town grew up around it, which was governed as part of
            British India. Following India's independence in 1947, Bangalore
            became the capital of Mysore State, and remained capital when
            the new Indian state of Karnataka was formed in 1956. The two
            urban settlements of Bangalore – city and cantonment – which
            had developed as independent entities merged into a single urban
            centre in 1949. The existing Kannada name, Bengalūru, was
            declared the official name of the city in 2006.
            Bangalore is widely regarded as the "Silicon Valley of India" (or
            "IT capital of India") because of its role as the nation's leading
            information technology (IT) exporter.[1] Indian technological
            organisations are headquartered in the city. A demographically
            diverse city, Bangalore is the second fastest-growing major
            metropolis in India.[17][18]
             Recent estimates of the metro economy
            of its urban area have ranked Bangalore either the fourth or fifthmost productive metro area of India.[10][19] Bangalore is home to
            7,700 millionaires and 8 billionaires with a total wealth of $320
            billion.[20][21] It is home to many educational and research
            institutions. Numerous state-owned aerospace and defence
            organisations, are located in the city. The city also houses the
            kannada film industry
